Clawdmeter polls Anthropic's usage API and turns it into a full set of Home Assistant
sensors — session and weekly limits, reset countdowns, and a layer of **computed
metrics the API doesn't give you**: live burn rate, time-to-limit, a "runway" verdict
and a color-coded pace frame. Built to pair with the pixel-art Clawdmeter ESPHome
display, but great on its own dashboard too.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Session & weekly usage** with reset timestamps and a live "resets in" countdown.
- **Weekly usage by surface** — how much of your weekly limit went to Claude Code, chat,
  Cowork and everything else.
- **Burn rate (5 min & 30 min)** in %/h — see how fast you are spending right now.
- **Time to limit** — minutes until you hit 100% at the current pace.
- **Runway** — does the session reset before you run out? You get a pace ratio, a signed
  margin and a "limit reached before reset" alert.
- **Pace frame & animation mood** — green/orange/red plus idle→heavy buckets, ready to
  drive a dashboard accent or an ESPHome creature.
- **Extra usage / overage** — credits, limit, percentage and a status (normal/warning/critical), from the legacy *and* new spend API.
- **Multi-account** — run a Pro and a Max account side by side; each gets its own device.
- **Resilient** — rides out brief API outages by holding the last values for a grace window instead of flipping everything to "unavailable".
- **English & German** UI out of the box, plus a configurable poll interval.

## 🃏 Animated Lovelace card

A companion animated card draws the **real pixel-art creature** (the original
[Clawdmeter](https://github.com/HermannBjorgvin/Clawdmeter) / [claudepix](https://claudepix.vercel.app)
animations) right on your dashboard. The creature's mood follows your burn rate
(idle → heavy) and its frame glows green/orange/red with the runway pace — exactly like
the ESPHome display.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corgan2222/lovelace-clawdmeter/main/images/card_preview.png" alt="Clawdmeter Lovelace card" width="680">
</p>

It lives in its own repository — **[corgan2222/lovelace-clawdmeter](https://github.com/corgan2222/lovelace-clawdmeter)** (HACS plugin, `type: custom:clawdmeter-card`).

## 🐾 ESPHome companion

These sensors are built to feed the animated **Clawdmeter** pixel-art display in
[esphome-modular-lvgl-buttons](https://github.com/corgan2222/esphome-modular-lvgl-buttons) — a
small ESP32 + LVGL screen that shows your Claude usage at a glance. The creature's mood
(idle → heavy) follows your burn rate, the breathing frame glows green/orange/red with the
runway pace, and the panel surfaces the usage and projection numbers — all driven straight
from the metrics above. Point the device's templates at your `clawdmeter` entities and it
stays in sync on every poll.

## 📊 Entities

Every account becomes one device named `Claude <name> (<plan>)`, so entities read as
`claude_<name>_<plan>_<type>`. In the device view they split into two groups: the
locally **computed** projections are the primary **Sensors**, and the **raw API**
readings sit under **Diagnostic**.

**Sensors** — computed by the integration:

| Group | Entities |
| --- | --- |
| Burn rate | Burn rate 5m · Burn rate 30m · Burn rate per minute · Usage rate |
| Projection | Time to limit · Session limit ETA |
| Runway | Runway pace · Runway margin · Limit reached before reset |
| Pace & peaks | Weekly pace · Session resets in · Session usage peak today |
| Mood | Animation group · Pace frame |
| Weekly by surface | Weekly Claude Code usage · Weekly chat usage · Weekly Cowork usage · Weekly other usage |

The **weekly by surface** sensors are in percent of the *weekly limit*: each surface's
share of this week's usage times the weekly usage. They add up to roughly the weekly
usage (the API rounds each share to a whole percent).

**Diagnostic** — straight from the usage / profile API:

| Group | Entities |
| --- | --- |
| Account | Account · Plan |
| Usage | Session usage · Weekly usage |
| Resets | Session reset · Weekly reset |
| Surface shares | Claude Code / Chat / Cowork / Other share of weekly usage |
| Overage | Extra usage · Extra usage status · Extra usage credits · Extra usage limit · Extra usage enabled |

> [!NOTE]
> **Weekly Sonnet / Opus sensors are deprecated.** The usage API no longer breaks usage
> down by model — those fields come back empty — so the four Sonnet/Opus sensors are now
> disabled by default and marked *(deprecated)*. If you still have them enabled, Home
> Assistant shows a repair notice; switch to the per-surface sensors and disable the old
> ones. They will be removed in a future release.

## 💤 States when Claude is idle

When nobody is using Claude — nights, weekends, holidays — the limits aren't moving.
Instead of showing "unknown" everywhere, Clawdmeter reports per-entity idle states that
keep history graphs continuous and meaningful:

| Entity | Idle state | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Burn rate 5m / 30m · Usage rate | `0` | No consumption means zero burn — and a gap-free graph over nights and weekends |
| Runway pace | `0` | At this pace the limit is never reached |
| Pace frame · Animation group | `green` · `idle` | Calm creature |
| Limit reached before reset | `off` | Nothing at risk |
| Time to limit · Runway margin | `unknown` | No ETA exists while usage is flat — a `0` would wrongly read as "at the limit now" |
| Usage %, resets, extra usage | live API value | Reflect the account regardless of activity |

## 🚀 Installation

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=darthrater78&repository=ha-clawdmeter&category=integration"><img alt="Add repository to HACS" src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg"></a>
  <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=clawdmeter"><img alt="Add integration to Home Assistant" src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg"></a>
</p>

**HACS (recommended)**

1. **[Add this repository to HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=darthrater78&repository=ha-clawdmeter&category=integration)** (or in HACS: ⋮ → **Custom repositories** → add it, category **Integration**), then install **Clawdmeter** and restart Home Assistant.
2. **[Add the Clawdmeter integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=clawdmeter)** (or **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Clawdmeter**).

**Manual** — copy `custom_components/clawdmeter` into your `config/custom_components/`
and restart.

## 🔑 Configuration

Clawdmeter authenticates with Anthropic over OAuth — there is no API key to manage:

1. Start the integration and open the authorization link it shows you.
2. Approve access and copy the code Anthropic displays (it may contain a `#` — copy the
   whole thing).
3. Paste it back and you are done. Add more accounts by repeating with a different login.

Tune how often it polls under the integration's **Configure** button (60–3600 s, default
300). The usage API is rate limited, so keep it sensible.

## 🔍 Diagnostics

From the device page choose **⋮ → Download diagnostics** to get the raw `usage` and
`profile` API responses side by side with the values the integration stores — handy for
spotting fields Anthropic returns that aren't surfaced as entities yet. Tokens, e-mail
and account identifiers are redacted, but the field names are kept.

## 📈 History & trends

Every percentage sensor is a `measurement`, so Home Assistant records its long-term
statistics automatically. Drop a **Statistics graph** card on, say, _Session usage_ or
_Session usage peak today_ to get daily / weekly / monthly trends (min, max, mean) — no
extra configuration needed.

## 🔔 Usage alerts

The integration ships an automation blueprint
(`custom_components/clawdmeter/blueprints/automation/usage_alert.yaml`) that fires an
action when a chosen usage sensor rises above a threshold.

1. Copy it to `config/blueprints/automation/clawdmeter/usage_alert.yaml` (or import it
   from its raw URL via **Settings → Automations & scenes → Blueprints → Import**).
2. Create an automation from **Clawdmeter usage alert**, pick a sensor (e.g. _Session
   usage_), a threshold (e.g. 80 %), and the action (e.g. a notification).

For the "you'll hit the limit before it resets" case, just trigger on the
_Limit reached before reset_ binary sensor instead.
